52-week high and low, and dividend yield. Historical Data Visualization: Plot the trend of the ETFâ€™s close price 
over a selected period (e.g., 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, etc.). User-Friendly Interface: A PyQt5-based GUI with 
intuitive inputs, dropdowns for time period selection, and buttons to check data, plot trends, and clear results.
